# Making Introductions

## Summary

Make introduction between host and known resources as needed.



## Considerations

* Consider the implications of the meta-data (email addresses, subject lines, dates) involved in these introductions.
* Provide PGP keys (signed if possible) for introductions where possible

## Walkthrough

Based on the specific recommendations in the audit report, as well as the auditor's understanding of the organization's capacity and barriers faced, introduce the relevant points of contact at the organization to resources such as digital security trainers, funding organizations which provide targeted support for digital security, technical experts to help on specific tasks (e.g. server hardening, website migration), as well as services that could help address their needs (e.g. secure hosting providers, rapid response support).

Follow up with both the organization and the resources introduced to check in on process and revise which introductions you make going forward.
