# Creating a Risk Matrix



## Materials Needed

## Walkthrough

After the activities are complete the auditor has tasks that build upon the outputs of the activities. These can be completed offsite.

  * Clean up critical process maps for use in reporting.
  * Create a list of all services or assets that were identified during the activity that were not already known by the auditor.
